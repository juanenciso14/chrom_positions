# chrom_positions

This is a small project that I made during my PhD to get initial positions from the chromosomes of a reference genome.

The full set of chromosomes and starting positions is the first argument to the program, written as columns separated by a single space. The query chromosomes are passed in a single column text file as the second argument.
